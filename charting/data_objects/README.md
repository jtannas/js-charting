# Data Objects

This contains js files that define various data objects (e.g. data point, data
series, data cluster) and their methods. These objects allow more information to
be passed in to graphs than raw numeric values. See the README inside for more
details.


## Listing

#### `point.js`
Defines the Point object, representing a single numerical value and optional meta data.

#### `series.js`
Defines the Series object, representing an array of Point objects and optional meta data.

#### `cluster.js`
Defines the Cluster object, representing an array of Series objects and optional meta data.
