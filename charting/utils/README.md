# Utilities Folder

This folder contains utility functions - generically useful functions that don't
fit in the Chart Object paradigm. Honestly, most of them could be extensions to
built-in Javascript types, but that polutes the Javascript namespace and is vulnerable
to conflicts.

Each file is named for the object it takes as its primary argument or that it extends.
