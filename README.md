# Project Stretch - Bar Chart API

This is a stretch project for preparing for the Lighthouse Labs Web Development
Bootcamp. It is for students who are already comfortable with the fundamentals
of code (e.g. variables, scope, control flow, etc...). The idea of it is to build
a node module for producing html bar graphs from a given set of data and options.

Full instructions are contained within the repo, via the file "lighthouse_instructions/
Project Stretch - Bar Chart Project Instructions.pdf".

## File & Folder Directory
Here, I will be keeping a listing of the files and folders in the base directory
and their purposes. Folders will have their own README.md files to explain them.

#### `charting/`
This is the base directory for the charting library contents. See the README inside for
more information.

#### `lighthouse_instructions/`
This is a directory where the instructions that accompanied the assignment are stored.
See the README inside for more information.

#### `sample/`
This is a directory where a sample usage of the library is given. See the README inside for
more information.

#### `.editorconfig`
This is a file given by lighthouse labs to help keep editor configurations consistent
across their students. It interacts with a plugin to common code editors to set the
editor configurations when working in the project containing it.

#### `.eslint.js`
This is a settings file for the eslint tool - a linter for javascript/ecmascript
code.

#### `.gitignore`
Tells git which files to exclude from version control.

#### `learning-resources.yml`
This is a file listing out the various resources I used when learning how to build
this project, along with notes on each of them.

#### `package.json`
Package.json files are a feature of node.js - the server side javascript framework.
They are used to track metadata about the package (e.g. dependencies, authors, etc...).
I just have them for my linter (ESLint).
